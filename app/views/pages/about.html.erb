					I am a proud father, a New York City native, and an alumni of Devcamp at Bottega.  I work hard every single day learning new coding languages, best practices, and algorithms to sharpen my skills as a software engineer.
					<hr>
					My passion is Full-Stack engineering.  I love the flexibility of coding from client-side to server-side, and the various challenges that brings.  I began with Ruby on Rails, and currently I am studying MERN-stack engineering.
					<br>
					May my efforts be reflected in this work.
